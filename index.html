    <h1>What happen to the MCU?</h1>
    <p>MCU is not like how it use to. Like being a Marvel fan back before 2019-2020 was great we had amazing movies Iron man, Black panther, and etc, but we can't forget about Infinity war and Endgame that was it peak. Ever since Marvel decided to bring shows to Disney+ it kind of fell off. In my opinion not even half of the shows on Disney+ are good and only a few movies were really good. But again it's my opinion.</p>

    <p>What are your thoughts with the MCU?</p>
